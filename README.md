# Handmade Hero in JAI

This repository contains the JAI code I write to follow Casey Muratori's Handmade Hero series.

For more information, refer to the following links:

- [Handmade Hero Episode Guide](https://guide.handmadehero.org/code/)
- [Handmade Hero Notes](https://yakvi.github.io/handmade-hero-notes/index.html) (notes for the first 29 days available)

Consider making a purchase of the source code and art work at [Handmade Hero](https://mollyrocket.com/#handmade) if you intend to follow the series long-term as part of your learning.
